# Connect 4
Connect 4 is a two-player, strategy game in which players choose a color, red or yellow, and take turns dropping their coins in a 6-row x 7-column grid. The goal of the game is for players to connect four of their coins in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The first person to get "four-in-a-row" is the winner!

I made this game because I enjoy strategy games and Connect 4 is one of my favorite games to play.

The game is hosted on Netlify below. Please feel free to play and please enjoy :)

## User Stories
- As a player, I want to play with another person.
- As a player, I want to choose a color, red or yellow, so we can distinguish ourselves.
- As a player, I want the game to decide who will go first.
- As the first player, I want to drop my coin first.
- As the second player, I want to drop my coin next.
- As a player, I want us to take turns dropping coins until someone gets four-in-a-row or until there is no more space on the grid.
- As a player, I want the first person to get four-in-a-row to be the winner! If not, the game should end in a tie.
- As a player, I want to be able to play again.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Netlify

## Approaches Taken
I decided to make this game similar to the Connect 4 board game that I grew up playing in elementary and middle school, so it's quite simple but very user-friendly and easy to dive right into. 

## Forthcoming Features
I would like to integrate a modal where one player can choose to play against the computer (perhaps on various difficulty levels) and an option for players to change their coin color (and as a result the in-game player text).
